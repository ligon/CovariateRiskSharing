This file describes the files that exist in different branches of the =git= repo named =CovariateRiskSharing=.  

* =master=
This branch has the core files.
- [[./Text/risk-sharing.org]] :: The ur-org file provides the entire Ms and code in a literate file that tangles all the code to generate tables and figures, then compiles to a complete \(\LaTeX\) representation of the paper incorporating those tables and figures.
- [[./Text/covariate_risksharing.bib]] :: Provides the bibliographic information for all material cited in [[./Text/risk-sharing.org]].
- [[./pyproject.toml]] :: A list of =python= packages sufficient for a complete working =python= environment.
- [[./.gitmodules]] :: Pointer to the data abstraction library from which one can borrow (most of) the Ugandan data for the project.

- [[./LICENSE.txt]] :: License governing use of this work.

* =results=
This branch is for building the paper.  It has all the files of =master=, plus outputs built using the [[./Makefile]]:
- Figures :: =png= files in [[./build/results/figures/]]
- Tables :: =orgmode= snippets in [[./build/results/]]

These derived files are added to the repo; figures as LFS objects.  
* =aer_editorial=

- [[./Text/AEA.cls]] :: The \(\LaTeX\) class file required by the American Economic Association.
- [[./Text/aea.bst]] :: The \BibTeX style file required by the American Economic Association.
- [[./Text/covariate_risksharing.bib]] :: Provides the bibliographic information for all material cited in [[./Text/covariate_risksharing.tex]].
