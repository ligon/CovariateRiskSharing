@ARTICLE{browning-etal94,
  ABSTRACT = {There is evidence from several sources that one cannot treat many-person households as a single decision maker. If this is the case, then factors such as the relative incomes of the household members may affect the final allocation decisions made by the household. A method of identifying how incomes affect outcomes, given conventional family expenditure data, is developed. The basic assumption the analysis makes is that household decision processes lead to efficient outcomes. The method is applied to a sample of Canadian couples with no children. The analysis finds that the final allocations of expenditures on each partner depend significantly on their relative incomes and ages and on the level of lifetime wealth. These effects are highly significant in a statistical sense. They also suggest that the influence of differential incomes and wealth on intrahousehold allocation can be fairly substantial.},
